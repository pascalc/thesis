# Narrative Roulette on the Web

* Web version was far less engaging than the classroom version.
* => Maybe we need the authority and distraction-free environment of a classroom to get students to focus on writing their narratives?
* => Counter-point: Preliminary results from Stories For Your Screen suggest that people would write narratives if they were in dialogue form. 
* Because that's the kind of texts they're used to writing?
* => Whatever the reason, the classroom is preferable.
