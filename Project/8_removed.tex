This lack of engagement was perhaps due to the loss of the classroom.
Without the classroom's atmosphere of authority, it was hard to motivate
students to participate in the microworld.

The content of the microworld doesn't seem to be problem, as engagement

extremely high\cite{ingulfson}. Instead, the problem seemed to be the
transition from a physical to a virtual space, which reduced the effectiveness of the
\textbf{evaluative} aspects of the microworld.
