# Narrative Roulette at Kungsholmens Gymnasium

* A creative writing workshop without constraints: the virtual microworld is our perception of reality, and we experiment using language (narrative theory).
* Tech enabled the anonymity
* Tech enabled so much work to be created, shared so quickly etc
* Did it work? 
* Was it engaging? Yes.
* Did it allow for experimentation? Yes. (especially the anonymity!)
* Did it give rich feedback? Yes. (especially the anonymity!)
