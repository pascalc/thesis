## What do exams reward?

## Are exams and microworlds at odds?


i.e., what does this paradigm mean in PRACTICE?

PRIMARY SOURCE: couldn't get a slot for Narrative Roulette until I offered it for substitute lessons.

* In short: Designing, implementing and running microworlds IS HARD. 
* The long version: it's not only HARDER, but also requires parents and the public to trust in students judgements: trusting students to do good work and to evaluate their peers fairly. It's easier to trust in a standardised system that provides quantifiable, measurable, comparable results.
* A classroom full of students exercising their imaginations is a more "computationally intensive" classroom to handle than one in which every student sits quietly reading a book.
* I don't mean to be overly cynical here. Even the most well-meaning teacher can be excused for grabbing an hour's peace after five hours of intense workshopping.
* So is this something structural? One student probably has more energy than one teacher. Thirty students, together, *definitely* do. 
* If the teacher is the depository of knowledge, the one who has to tell students what to do, and then check if they're correct, or at least on the right track, the teacher will be the bottleneck, even if helped by Teaching Assistants.
* To increase the efficiency of our system, we can remove the need of the teacher to be the depository of information. That can be provided by information technology, such as internet-connected computers. This depository is an improvement on textbooks as it is interactive, so provided better feedback.
	* So, Khan Academy, Worrydream, Codecademy style teaching instead of textbooks? Will the establishment believe that these sources have academic merit? Is there an equivalent of the Cambridge University Press?
* The teacher will then be the one monitoring students finding and applying their own discovered knowledge, each in their own way. 
* Will a teacher tell a student that they're doing it wrong?
* Not necessarily. Instructive failure is a rich source of learning
	* [http://chronicle.com/article/How-Failure-in-the-Classroom/146377/][1]
* Teachers will allow students to fail, only guiding students if they enter waters that are an irrelevant part of the domain.
* Teachers will no longer be the arbiters of what is correct. We will have functional peer evaluation: does the student's work successfully fulfil its purpose, according to how their peers *behave* (not according to what they *say*).
	* Do their peers engage with and discuss their peer's texts?
	* Videos?
	* Software?
	* Physical artifacts?
	* etc.
* So what are teachers for?
	* GUIDANCE. They provide experience. This is what they have that students don't.
* Will this shift in the role of teacher and student come to pass? Will governments and teachers let students take charge of figuring out what to do, and saying whether it's good or not?
* No. Why? 
	* It makes a student's progress harder to measure.
	* Instead of saying that a student received an A on a standardised Math test, we will have to say that a student made a project involving Math, Linguistics and Creative Writing. Is it any good? Well, other students liked it.
	* Governments will feel this lacks rigor and formality. It's not an easy sell to voters. Pledging to improve PISA scores is.
	* If a government wants to do something, teachers will have to follow. Never mind that it might reduce their paperwork and bureaucratic tasks; that it might put them back in the classroom doing what they most enjoy.

Conclusion: It is unlikely the microworld paradigm will be deployed in mainstream curricula without political support. This political support does not seem to be there, or on the horizon, as of 2014.

It all boils down to trust. Can we trust students to learn for the sake of learning, instead of studying for the sake of grades and future prospects?

In the end, I think we'll have to compromise. The more we trust students, the more they'll be allowed to use microworlds. This means when they are youngest (as small kids are trusted more) and oldest (research etc is a massive microworld). 

High-school children and younger teenagers (12-15) are trusted the least. So they'll have to put up with the most traditional education.

Is there anything we can do? Yes: we can sneak in this paradigm where there is no set curriculum - substitute lessons... 

---- 
* harder to test - harder for teachers to show politicians and parents that they are doing their job; harder for politicians to show the public that they are doing their job.
* requires more creativity on the part of individual teachers - if there were no grades, they can no longer use the threat of bad grades to "motivate" students. That means that they have to come up with work that students want to do *because it's fun*. They have to compete with 
* everything else that vies for student's attention: things like the internet, TV, movies, music, etc etc.
* Breaks down the distinctions between subjects. My workshops  involved Creative Writing, Leadership and Psychology. Most microworlds bridge multiple disciplines. Which teachers should teach them? Which budget will fund it, the humanities or natural science?
