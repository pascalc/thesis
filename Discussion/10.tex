\section{What do microworlds mean for education?}

Let's compare the structure of traditional teaching methods with
microworlds. Traditional teaching is often split into three activities:
lectures, exercise sessions, and exams. Lectures provide students with
theory, exercise sessions (or seminars) allow students to put that
theory into practice by solving problems, and exams allow students to
demonstrate both their theoretical and practical skills, in isolation -
test conditions, generally with no help from textbooks, the internet or
their peers.

There are rough parallels between these methods and microworlds.
Lectures correspond to \textbf{ideas} in a certain domain. A major
difference between ideas in lectures and ideas in microworlds is that
ideas in lectures are \emph{external}. They are other people's ideas,
such as ``Recursive loops never terminate if you leave out a
base-case''. In a microworld, the ideas you have are \emph{internal},
your own: ``If I write this base-case, my loop will terminate.''.

Exercises correspond to \textbf{implementation}. However, unlike
microworlds, traditional exercise sessions have students implementing
external ideas. For example: ``This is Pythagoras' theorem, now apply it
to this scenario!''. In a microworld, it is a student's internal ideas
that are implemented: ``I wonder if I can use Pythagoras' theorem to
help me draw a right-angled triangle.''

Exams are the \textbf{evaluation} stage. Unlike microworlds, exams do
not give instant feedback. Failing at problem-solving in an exam is not
a learning experience, it results in a period of uncertainty, which ends
when you receive a grade lower than you were expecting. If having your exam marked by a teacher
taught you something, perhaps how to solve a problem correctly, after
the course is over, you have no way to apply that knowledge, or to prove
that you now have it.

When you fail at problem solving in a microworld, you know immediately,
enabling you to update your understanding immediately. Evaluation is
\emph{productive} in a microworld, in a way that exams generally aren't.

In short, traditional learning methods do provide \textbf{ideas},
\textbf{implementation} and \textbf{evaluation}, but in components that
are spread out in time. A microworld places these components in a tight
loop that is iterated many times at speed. It is for this reason that
microworlds lead to more learning than traditional teaching methods.

\subsection{Agile methods vs The Waterfall Method}

There are echoes of this comparison in Software Engineering ideology.
Traditional teaching methods arguably correspond with The Waterfall
Method. The Waterfall Method consists of \cite{wiki:waterfall}: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Requirements and Design (Microworld \textbf{idea}s). 
\item Implementation (Microworld \textbf{implementation}, obviously). 
\item Verification (Microworld \textbf{evaluation}).
\end{enumerate}

As in traditional teaching, these steps are separated in time. The
requirements and software design are done first, before any
implementation. Then the implementation is carried out. Finally, the
implementation is verified by the customer.

According to Dean Leffingwell and many others, ``the Waterfall Method
doesn't work''\cite{leffingwell}. Instead, most modern software engineers
prefer agile methods.

These agile methods move the requirements, design, implementation and
verification steps closer in time, and prefer fast iterations. Agile
methods make software engineering into a microworld.

\subsection{Are there schools teaching microworlds right now?}

\subsubsection{Berghs School of Communication}

Berghs School of Communication, an educational institution in Stockholm, uses Action-Based Learning, a philosophy that is similar to microworlds as defined in this paper.

Read about their pedagogy \href{http://www.berghs.se/content/berghs-pedagogik}{here} (Swedish). 

\subsubsection{Hyper Island}

Hyper Island, a global educational institution, uses ``constructivist methodology''.
