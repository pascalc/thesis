* So microworlds with tight idea-implementation-evaluation loops seem to work, especially when we use technology to eliminate book-keeping (such as keeping things anonymous, collecting submissions etc). 
* Workshops \> Lectures.
* Workshops \> Seminars (better to create something before discussing it).
* Who else is doing this?
* Does KTH implement this? Sometimes.
	* Argue that a programming assignment can be a microworld in a way that a matteövning isn't. 
		* Implementation-Evaluation isn't enough! We need freedom to have our own ideas!

## Evaluating work
* How do we evaluate work when students can come up with their own ideas?
* Narrative Roulette submissions were naturally evaluated based on two criteria: 
	* Entertaining/engaging to read.
	* Dealt with subject in an interesting way.
* Don't existing curricula test these very things??
* Not exactly. Curricula test whether a student's work is well-written or interesting *according to teachers or authorities*. Narrative Roulette lets *other students* make that judgement. 
	* Peer evaluation is stronger than the evaluation of an authority figure. 
	* However, if grades are set based on peer evaluations, students may just give out good grades regardless of the quality of the work (they have no incentive to be truthful, unless their grading is being graded, defeating the purpose, but they do have an incentive to be nice to their friends).

	* Instead, we can look at what students actually *do*. We could measure how many reads a narrative gets. We could measure likes. We could measure how many comment on it.
		* We could grade code projects by how many people try it out, and how many people keep using it. 
		* We could grade presentations by how many people view, like, comment. 
		* The same goes for articles.
	* This would mean, instead of writing essays for your teacher, you write articles for your blog, using whatever images, CSS, JS etc you want. Then you share those articles on social media, and monitor them using Google Analytics etc.
	* So instead of getting students to write mini-research papers in the form of lab reports and academic essays, we would train them to write BuzzFeed articles?
	* If students do not enjoy their work, they will stop doing it as soon as the threat of academic failure has been removed. Being forced to read Shakespeare at school does not help if you never touch a book after graduating. 
	* But students don't know what they want! They don't know what's good! We force them to read Shakespeare for their own good, and some of them will find something that speaks to them, that they wouldn't have found if we hadn't forced it upon them!
	* Sure. But *more* people will find something they like in Shakespeare if they can *make it their own*, using their ideas, that they can implement and evaluate themselves.
	* Shakespeare Day is a dramatic microworld with a long tradition at Kungsholmens Gymnasium. It is consistently reported as being the most engaging and entertaining project in the first year.
	* Then surely we need a balance? Microworlds for some things, and traditional curricula for others? Keep Shakespeare day *and* essays about Shakespearean sonnets! Creative writing workshops *and* academic essays! Don't both fulfil a purpose, have a niche?
	* I disagree. In my opinion, there is no niche in which a traditional approach is superior than a well-designed and implemented microworld.
	* Why? Because I believe that is how we learn in the world outside of school. I base that on my own experience of studying at KTH and working at a startup simultaneously for more than 2 years. 
		* Malcolm Knowles: "Adults don't learn what someone else dictates they ought to learn; adults learn what they them­selves feel they need to learn in order to survive and progress through life's stages"

	* Surely that proves the opposite point? That we need a balance of the academic and the practical?
	* Not quite. It's hard to prevent programming assignments from becoming microworlds. And microworlds do not preclude academic knowledge. We could easily restate our microworld mechanic as:
		1. Self-directed research
			2. Idea
			3. Implementation
			4. Evaluation
			5. GOTO 1
	* It takes research to create successful products and works of art. So what's the core difference between school and life, between academia and microworlds?
	* In life, no-one tells you exactly what to read, what to do, or how to succeed. There are no grading criteria that can guarantee success, if you follow them to the letter.
	* How about this: Do well at school. Be social. Get a good degree, then a good job. Be a good employee. Rise in the ranks. Build a successful life for yourself.
	* People have argued that following that plan tends to lead you to some kind of glass ceiling:

	* In a microworld, *you* have to come up with something to do. *You* have to figure out if it's working. You have to figure out whether to stick to your current strategy, or to change. And every moment you spend pondering that decision, and doing things based on those thoughts, you're learning. 
	* Consider two AIs: one rule-based, the other employing Machine Learning. Which AI is the one providing results today? 
	* So, do I expect every school to abandon the methods that have served them well for years, and educated billions of people perfectly well, and base everything around microworlds instead? I'd love it if they did that. But I know that they won't. And here's why... NEXT SECTION.

---- 
* More microworlds in the classroom - more creativity!
* Functional evaluation
