# Analysing Narrative Roulette submissions

Perspective: 
*You are female. You are the captain of a sinking ship. You must motivate your crew and help them work together to save everyoneâ€™s lives.*

> I would first gather everyone and make up a strategic plan. In this plan I would make sure that everyone knew their specific task. Before letting everyone go and perform their task(s) I would make sure that everyone is calm and concentrated. Afterwards, when everyone is busy with their task, I would contact an emergency center, e.g. 112.  

This is good advice, but uninteresting and predictable. It reads like a teenager's answer to a question posed during a job interview.
